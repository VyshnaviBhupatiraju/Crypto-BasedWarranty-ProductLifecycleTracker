# Crypto-Based Warranty Product Lifecycle Tracker

## Project Description

The Crypto-Based Warranty Product Lifecycle Tracker is a revolutionary blockchain-based smart contract system that digitizes and automates product warranty management and lifecycle tracking. This comprehensive solution enables manufacturers, retailers, service providers, and consumers to interact transparently in a decentralized ecosystem where product warranties, service records, and ownership transfers are immutably recorded on the blockchain.

The system eliminates traditional paper-based warranty cards and centralized databases, replacing them with a trustless, transparent, and globally accessible digital warranty management platform. Every product gets a unique digital identity from manufacturing to disposal, creating an unbreakable chain of custody and service history.

    const checkWarranty = async () => {
      const status = await contract.isUnderWarranty(productId);
      const expiration = await contract.getWarrantyExpirationDate(productId);
      setWarrantyStatus({ active: status, expirationDate: expiration });
    };
    
    if (productId) checkWarranty();
  }, [productId]);
  
  return warrantyStatus;
};
```
